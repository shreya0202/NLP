# Non Linear Regression 1D Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
# Description
NLP This project is an experiment performed where a nonlinear regression 1D Convolution Neural Network model is applied on California housing dataset to  predict median house value using longitude, latitude, housing median age, total number of rooms, total number of bedrooms, population, number of households, and median income.The dataset used for the experiment  is a modified version of the California Housing dataset. 

# Source
This dataset featured in a paper entitled Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry's Sparse Spatial Autoregressions, issue of the journal Statistics and Probability Letters in the year 1997.   They constructed it using information from the 1990 California census. It involves one row for each group of census blocks. A block community is the smallest unit in the geography for which the U.S. Census Bureau posts sample data, traditionally, a block has a population of 600 to 3,000.
